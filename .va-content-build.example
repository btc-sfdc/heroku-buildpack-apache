# VA Content-Build Configuration
#
# This file enables the buildpack to recognize this as a VA content-build deployment.
# Copy this file to .va-content-build in your repository root to activate.
#
# Example:
#   cp .va-content-build.example .va-content-build

VA_CONTENT_BUILD=true

# CONTENT OPTIMIZATION (HIGHLY RECOMMENDED)
# =========================================
# Specify which content types to build. This can reduce build time from hours to minutes!
#
# Set this as a Heroku environment variable:
#   heroku config:set CONTENT_TYPES="pages,navigation,forms"
#
# Available content types:
# - pages: Standard content pages
# - landing-pages: Landing pages
# - forms: VA forms
# - offices: Office pages
# - healthcare: Healthcare region pages
# - qa: Q&A content
# - guides: Step-by-step guides
# - media: Images and videos
# - checklists: Checklists
# - support: Support resources
# - campaigns: Campaign landing pages
# - stories: Stories
# - news: News stories
# - press-releases: Press releases
# - events: Events
# - outreach: Outreach pages
# - navigation: Site navigation (menus, sidebars, footer)
# - alerts: Alerts and notifications
# - banners: Banner alerts
# - taxonomy: Taxonomy terms
# - homepage: Homepage content
#
# Example configurations:
#
# Minimal (fastest build, ~5-10 minutes):
#   CONTENT_TYPES="pages,navigation"
#
# Common use case (moderate build, ~30-60 minutes):
#   CONTENT_TYPES="pages,landing-pages,forms,navigation,media"
#
# Full site (slowest, 4-8 hours):
#   Leave CONTENT_TYPES unset or empty
